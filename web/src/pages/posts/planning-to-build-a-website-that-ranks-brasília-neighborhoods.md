It's incredible how easy it is to not know your own surroundings. Especially in a city like Brasília, where everything is hidden by vast amounts of pure grass.

People don't know the different neighborhoods that exist. And they don't know the little good pockets in those neighborhoods. Myself included. I've moved to a neighborhood in Brasília which I knew nothing about a year ago, and it's been great!

Because of that, I've felt the need to build a ranking. Sort of like nomads.com, but I would put it in a tier list. I find tier lists to be a superior ranking method than just putting numbers on things, because most things are very similar. 5th place might be as good as 1st place.

Anyway, let's plan this.

There are different qualities a neighborhood can have so we should assign a weight to each one. The only thing that is obvious to me is that safety should have the biggest weight. Every big city has pockets of safety and pockets where you can't hold your phone at broad daylight. I'd say brazilian cities are one of the biggest offenders when it comes to inequality. Brasília (and surrounding areas) has Lago Sul which has the HDI of Switzerland. It also has the biggest favela in Brazil in Sol Nascente.

Therefore, ranking safety is the biggest of deals: it's the difference between walking with your family at night and fearing for your life at day.

I've just realized I want this really well done. There are many modules that make up a neighborhood. Safety is it's own rabbit hole. Maybe I should just deliver the first module? A website that ranks Brasília's neighborhoods by safety?

I'll dive into that. The different types of crime will have different weights. I'll just get into a chat with AI.
